    "# Community Reports\n",
    "Building reports from the Augur database schema is an important way for catalogouing questions that our users ask, as well as how we can make the most of the extensive, validated data Augur gathers. Everything is not \"dashboard material\". Over time, reports people find useful will become APIS in Augur that can be used to construct automated community reports. This is a repository for engaged requirements gathering in the agile spirit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The template directory is where we begin to understand what the reports \"are\", as we expect individual users to create their own directories where they make new reports, work with us to create new reports, and then share them with the CHAOSS community. The goal is to then build generalized augur queries/APIs, etc, and make them available as tools. \n",
